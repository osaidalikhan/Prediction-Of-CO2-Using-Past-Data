# Prediction-of-CO2-using-past-data
Polynomial regression

We have used annual data and predicted the global production of CO2 for the years 2011,2012 and 2013

Libraries we used:

 * numpy
 * pandas for dataframes
 * matplotlib for plotting graphs
 * sklearn for pre processing and fitting the data
